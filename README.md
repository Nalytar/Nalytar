- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nalytar, but usually people call me Michael :D

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in a retraining for IT-Specialist with IHK-degree as application developer (in German: Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung mit IHK Abschluss).

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things... sometimes i'm just the casual nerd and play some videogames or card/boardgames
 or go on a walk with my dog (Husky... and yeah she is really stubborn ^^").
 But from time to time i just enjoy spending time with the family since im a happy dad of 1 little boy and also got a lovely girlfriend.
 Since i started my retraining i really enjoy coding and looking into diffrent programming languages.
 But my journey just begun and im looking forward to many projects where i can bring in my ideas!
